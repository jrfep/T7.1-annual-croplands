The SDPT contains 173 million hectares of planted forest and 50 million hectares of agricultural trees, or approximately 82% of the world’s total planted forest area in 2015 (FAO 2015). The SDPT was compiled through a procedure that included cleaning and processing each individual data set before creating a harmonized attribute table.
